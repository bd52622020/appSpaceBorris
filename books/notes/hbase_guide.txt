                            HBASE: The definitive guide
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preface
-------
Hush use case, short for HBase URL shortener, you simply hand in a URL and get a much 
shorter link back.

Introduction
------------
Companies have become focused on deliverying more targeted information, such as recommendations or 
online ads, and their ability to do so directly influences their success as a business. Systems like 
Hadoop new enables to gather and process petabytes of data, and the need to collect even more data.

Hadoop
------
Excels at storing data of arbitrary, semi, or even unstructured formats, since it lets you decide how 
to interpret the data at analysis time, allowing you to change the way you classify the data at analysis time and change the classification at any time. It is optimized for large file storage and 
batch-oriented, streaming access. 

Columnn-oriented databases
--------------------------
Save their data grouped by columns. Subsequent column values are stored continuously on idsk, this differs from the usual row-oriented approach of traditional databases, which store entire rows contiguously.

	-The reason to store values on a per-column basis instead is based on the assumption that,
	 for specific queries, not all of the values are needed. This is often the case in analytical
	 databases and therefore they are good candidates for the different storage schema.
	-Reduced I/O is one of the primary reasons for this new layout, but it offers additonal 
	 advantages playing into the same category:
	-Since the values of one column are often very similar in nature, they are often much better
	 suited for compression.
	-Specialized algorithms such as delta and prefix compression, selected based on the type of 
	 the column, can yield huge improvements in compression ratios and resulting in more efficient
	 bandwidth usage.
	 
Format
------
HBase utilizes an on-disk column storage format. It is distinctly different from traditional columnar databases, HBase excels at providing key-based access to a specific cell of data, or sequential range of cells.

Collecting data
---------------
Sales: Data generated by point-of-sale (POS) or stock/inventory systems.
Cellular services: which all collect a tremendous amount of data as well.
