Preface
-------
Real-time data and stream processing at scale

  -Understanding publish/subscribe messaging and how it fits in the big data ecosystem
  -Explore Kafka producers and consumers for writing and reading messages
  -Understand Kafka patterns and use case requirements to ensure reliability data delivery
  -Get best practices for building data pipelines and applications with Kafka
  -Manage Kafka in production, including monitoring, tuning, and maintenance tasks
  -Learn the most critical metrics among Kafka's operational measurements
  -Explore how Kafka's stream delivery capabilities make it a perfect source for stream processing
   systems

Foreword
--------
The observation was simple, there were lots of databases and other systems built to store data, but
what was missing in the architecture was something that would help to handle the continuous flow of
data.

  -Kafka is a system that lets you publish and subscribe to streams of data, store them, and process
  them.
  -Kafka works as a modern distributed system that runs on a cluster and is able to scale to handle
  all the applications.
  -Central platform that can scale elastically to handle all the streams of data
  -Kafka is a true storage system built to store data, the data is replicated and persistent.
  -Kafka let you compute derived streams and datasets dynamically off of your streams.

Hadoop-like
-----------
Kafka can be viewed as a real-time version of Hadoop, Kafka lets you store and continuously process 
streams of data. Hadoop targeted analytics applications often in data warehousing space, Kafka due
to its low latency makes it applicable for core applications that directly power a business.
Events in a business are happening all the time and the ability to react to them as they occur make
it much easier to build services that directly power the operation of the business.

  -Kafka gets compared to ETL and data integration tools 
  -Kafka is a platform oriented around real-time streams of events, it can power custom applications
   built to trigger off of these same data streams.
  -Architecture is centered around streams of events
  -In some ways these flows of data are the most central aspect of a modern digital company
