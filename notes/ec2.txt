					EC2

General purpose:
----------------
Provide a balance of compute, memory and netwroking resources.

Compute Optimized:
------------------
Ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance
processors. They are well suited for batch processing workloads, media
transcoding, high performance web servers and other compute intensive
applications.

Memory Optimized:
-----------------
Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large
data sets in memory.
 
Accelerated Computing:
----------------------
Use hardware eccelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions, such as 
floating point number calculations, graphics processing or data pattern 
matching more efficiently than running on CPUs.

Storage Optimized:
------------------
Designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access
to very large data sets on local storage. Optimized to deliver tens of 
thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to 
applications.

What is EC2?
------------
Is a web-service which provides secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
  -Scale up/down
  -Can be integrated into several other services
  -Pay only for what you use 

Use case - Notifying users about a newsletter using EC2, SNS and S3
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-SNS: Simple notification service 
-EC2: Compute
-S3: Storage

How to create
-------------
A key pair, consisting of a public key that AWS stores and a private key that you store.
Together they allow to securely connect to your instance.
  -.PEM file
  -PuTTY is used generally when there's a requirement for a windows system to connect with 
   a linux system, Putty does not accept .pem files --> PPK

1) Chosing an AMI (Amazon machine image)
  -The AMI is a template that is used to create a new instance on user requirement 
    -Software
    -OS
    -Additional applications
2) Choosing an instance type 
  -Specifies the hardware specifications that are required in the machine
    -Compute optimized
    -Memory optimized: In-memory cache
    -Storage optimized 
    -General purpose
3) Configure instance
  -The number of instances
  -Purchase options: reserved, spot, on demand
  -Assign EC2 instance
  -AIM role
  -Network type
  -When to assign a public IP
  -Bootstrap instance with scripts
4) Adding storage 
  -Ephemeral storage: Temporary and free
  -Amazon elastic block store: Permanent and paid 
  -S3
  -The size in GBs, volume type, location in disk 
5) Adding tags 
  -Identify a machine 
6) Configure security group
  -Security groups: Firewall
    -Port numbers 
    -IP address
