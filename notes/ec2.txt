					EC2

General purpose:
----------------
Provide a balance of compute, memory and netwroking resources.

Compute Optimized:
------------------
Ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance
processors. They are well suited for batch processing workloads, media
transcoding, high performance web servers and other compute intensive
applications.

Memory Optimized:
-----------------
Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large
data sets in memory.
 
Accelerated Computing:
----------------------
Use hardware eccelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions, such as 
floating point number calculations, graphics processing or data pattern 
matching more efficiently than running on CPUs.

Storage Optimized:
------------------
Designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access
to very large data sets on local storage. Optimized to deliver tens of 
thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to 
applications.
