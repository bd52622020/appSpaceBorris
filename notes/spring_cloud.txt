					Spring Cloud

Components
----------
-Configuration
-Service Discovery
-Circuit Breakers
-Routing and messaging
-API Gateway
-Tracing
-CI Pipelines and testing 


Configuration
-------------
-Outside the application, to a centralized store across all environments 
-Spring cloud config server can use Git, SVN, filesystem 
-Config clients(microservice apps) retrieve the configuration from the server

Service Discovery
-----------------
-Communication between microservices, easiliy discover the routes to the 
services it needs to use
-Zookeeper
Producer --> register --> Service registry --> discover --> Consumer --> Connect

Routing and messaging 
---------------------
-Could native app will be composed of many microservices 
-Supports communication via HTTP requests or via messaging 
-Messaging: Kafka 

API Gateway
-----------
-Allows to route API requests (Internal or external) to the correct service 
-Spring cloud gateway, load balancer

Circuit Breakers
----------------
-Protect microservices from failure 
-If requests fails --> after certain number of times 

Tracing
-------
-Spring cloud Sleuth and Zipkin

CI Pipelines and testing
------------------------
-Allows to accurately mock dependencies between services using published contracts
