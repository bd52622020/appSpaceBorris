-Unit testing
-Integration testing
-Avro and schema compatibility testing
-Confluent cloud tools
-Multi-datacenter testing


Unit Testing
------------
-Producers, reducers testing
-Kafka-streams-test-util for writing tests

Integration testing
-------------------
-To make sure everything is ayncronous
-Producers and consumers running parallely? 
-Embedded kafka cluster  

Avro and schema compatibility testing
-------------------------------------
-Producers write messages, passing JSON data while the producer is working 
-The schame is implied, thus it has to be tested to make sure they match
-Schema registry, how the schema can evolve 
-Once schema is defined for the JSON is the avro
-Mock schema library client - for testing 


Multi-datacenter testing
------------------------
-Compare data moving from kafka deployments to make sure they match. 
-Insuce failures, ability to recover and publish data.
-General type of testing
-Make sure pipeline is not dependant on a single cluster.
