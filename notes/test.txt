EMR
---
Run apache tools in the cluster
  -Similar to hortonworks, replicated on cloud.
  -Kinesis --> Similar to Kafka based on the cloud 

-Elastic map reduce
  -Hadoop ecosystem

Kinesis
-------
Messaging system, distributed, replicated, fault tolerant
three types:
-Kineses Analytical: Concluent kafka similar 
  -Real time stream of data, process and analyse data on real time
-Kineses firehouse: Diistributed messaging system 
  -Partitions == sharding 
  -Similar to Kafka
  -Consumer/producer
-Kineses stream: Stream data 
  -Similar to spark streaming

Dinamo Db
---------
Similar to HBase

kineses vs kafka
----------------

RDS
---
Connect to external database, relational database service
  -Connect EMR to SQL server
  -Code JDBC driver

Lambda
------
Repeating and redundant job, multiple things to do 
  -Parallel procesing
  -Event trigger: AWS pipelines
    -Between EMR and S3: EMR is expensive to run, cluster will run 

Glue
----
Analysis

Snowflake
---------
Database management system
  -Schema
  -RDBMS 
  -Connect SQL server
  -Manage databases 

Control M
---------
Similar to 
-Airflow
-Oozier

Data integration
----------------
Data management: AWS RDS

Hadoop stack
------------
Hive:
  -External tables:
    -Only the metadata get deleted not the data
  -Internal tables: Temporary, once done, it can be droped
    -Managed tables: When you drop the tables, the metadata and tables gets droped

Partitons: Taking a large data set and diving the large dataset, data will be distributed in an equal way
Bucketing: Once data is partition, if you want to further divide, it has a certain amount of partitions
  -Consider the size
  -Consider resources
  -8GB total -- 2GB bucket
  -1/4   1/3
  -Can have one node for Hive --> optional

Hive architecture
-----------------
Driver: compiler, check
Submit query:
  -Driver: Compiler, checks for syntax
  -Metastore: Metadata of table, check for info
  -Execution engine: map of how it is going to get executed 
  -MapReduce

Apache spark vs EMR spark
-------------------------
