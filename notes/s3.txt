				S3

Fundamental data storage, everything is an object.

-Storage for the internet
-Natively online, HTTP access
-Allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data, anytime, from 
anywhere on the web
-High scalable, reliable, fast and durable

Use cases
---------
-Storage & backup
-Application file hosting
-Media hosting
-Software delivery
-Store AMIs and snapshots 

Concepts
--------
-Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets
-An object is composed of a file and optionally any metadata that
describes that file
-You can have up to 100 buckets in each account
-You can access control to the buckets

Object Key
---------
-An object key is the unique identifier for an object in a bucket 

S3 Security
----------
-You can control access to buckets and objects with
	-Access control lists(ACLs)
	-Bucket policies
	-Identity and access management (IAM) policies 
-You can encrypt data

S3 Versioning
-------------
-Protects from accidental overwrites and deletes with no performance 
pernalty 
-Generates a new version with every upload
-Allows easily retrieval of deleted objects or roll back to previous
versions

Object Lifecycle
----------------
-Log files
-Archive documents
-Digital media archives
-Financial and healthcare records
-Raw genomics sequence data
-Long-term database backups
-Data that must be retained for regulatory compliance

S3 Pricing
----------
-Pay only for what you use
-Based on location of your amazon S3 bucket
-Storage pricing 
-Request pricing
-Data transfer pricing

Amazon S3-glacier
--------------
-Long term low-cost archiving 
-Infrequently accessed data
-Three to five hours standard retrieval time


Amazon Elastric Block Store (EBS)
---------------------------------
-Persistent block level storage volumes offer consistent and low-latency
performance 
-Stored data is automatically replicated within its availability Zone
-Snapshots are stored durably in Amazon S3

Life cycle
----------
-Vast amounts of unused space 
-Create: Call createVolume 1GiB to 16TiB
-Attach: Call attachVolume to affiliate with one amazon EC2 instance
-Attached and in use: Format from Amazon EC2 instance OD - Mount drive
-Create snapshot: Snapshot to Amazon S3
-Detach: Call detach volume
-Delete: Call delete volume

Volume types
------------
-SSD-backed volumes
	-Optimized for transactional workloads that involve frequent read
	write operations with msall I/O size - General purpose
	-Highest performance for mission critical app  - Provisioned 
-HHD-back volumes 
	-Low cost HDD designed for frequently accessed - Optimized
	-Low cost HDD designed for less frequently accessed workloads - cold

Why EBS 
-------
-Long-term persistence 
-Launch volumes as encrypted volumes
-You can create point-in-time snapshots of EBS volumes, which are persisted
to Amazon S3

Amazon EBS Use Cases
-------------------
-OS: Use for boot/root volume
-Databases: Sclaes with your performance 
-Enterprise applications: Provides reliable block storage to run 
mission critical applications
-Business continuity: Minimize data loss and recovery time by regularly
backing up using EBS snapshots
-Applications: Install and presist any application 

EBS Scope
---------
-Amazon EBS volumes are in single availability zones

Difference 
----------
Storage layer persistency


AWS Shared responsibility model
------------------------------
-Customers are responsible for security IN the cloud
-AWS is responsible for the security OF the cloud 


SSL Endpoints
-------------
-SSL enpoints : Secure transmission to establish secure communication
sessions (HTTPS)
-Security groups: Instance firewalls
-PVC: Network control use public and private NAT, VPN support in your private
cloud

AWS Multi-tier Security groups
------------------------------
-Web tier
-Application tier
-Database tier

AWS Indentity and access management
-----------------------------------
-IAM users and their access 

AWS IAM authentication
----------------------
-Access key and secret key
-Access to a particular service

AWS IAM user management groups
------------------------------
-User
-Dev ops group
-Tester

AWS IAM authorization
---------------------
-IAM Policies are JSON documents to describe permision 

AWS cloudTrail
--------------
-Records AWS API calls for accounts
-Delivers log files with information
