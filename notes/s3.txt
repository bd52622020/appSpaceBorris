				                              S3 - Simple Storage Solution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is S3?
-----------
Object storage, no constraints in the type of data stored. Datalake 
-Folder storage
-Cost effective for storage
-Built in redundancy, duplicating the bucket
-Access cost

Why is S3 usefull?
------------------
-Cheap, reliable way to store objects 
-Low latency, high throughput access
-Easily be used to host static websites 
-Can integrate with SNS, SQS, Lambda for powerful event driven applications
-Life cycle management, shift away old data into long term storage for cost reduction

S3 Security
----------
-You can control access to buckets and objects with
	-Access control lists(ACLs)
	-Bucket policies
	-Identity and access management (IAM) policies 
-You can encrypt data

S3 Versioning
-------------
-Protects from accidental overwrites and deletes with no performance 
pernalty 
-Generates a new version with every upload
-Allows easily retrieval of deleted objects or roll back to previous
versions

Walkthrough
-----------
Create bucket:
  -Bucket name, region, copy settings
  -Versioning, server access logging, Tags (track project cost)
  -Object level logging using cloud trail
  -Cloud watch request metrics, cost
  -Block public access
Upload files:
  -Folder like structure
  -Upload files
  -Access for other AWS account
  -Tier: standard, intelligent, glacier
  -Encryption
  -Metadata
  -Tags
Settings:
  -Overview
  -Properties: Transfer acceleration, static website hosting
    -S3 event: Inserting file, broadcast event to other services such as PUT --> New events created
      -Prefix: Only apply the event for a particular folder
      -Suffix: Certain file types
      -Send to: SNS topic, SQS queue or Lambda function
    -Request pays: Ecosystem with multiple accounts, model where whoever is doing the request is
      paying the access cost
  -Permissions: 
    -Block public access
    -Bucket policy: Who, roles, permissions
  -Management









Amazon Elastric Block Store (EBS)
---------------------------------
-Persistent block level storage volumes offer consistent and low-latency
performance 
-Stored data is automatically replicated within its availability Zone
-Snapshots are stored durably in Amazon S3

Life cycle
----------
-Vast amounts of unused space 
-Create: Call createVolume 1GiB to 16TiB
-Attach: Call attachVolume to affiliate with one amazon EC2 instance
-Attached and in use: Format from Amazon EC2 instance OD - Mount drive
-Create snapshot: Snapshot to Amazon S3
-Detach: Call detach volume
-Delete: Call delete volume

Volume types
------------
-SSD-backed volumes
	-Optimized for transactional workloads that involve frequent read
	write operations with msall I/O size - General purpose
	-Highest performance for mission critical app  - Provisioned 
-HHD-back volumes 
	-Low cost HDD designed for frequently accessed - Optimized
	-Low cost HDD designed for less frequently accessed workloads - cold

Why EBS 
-------
-Long-term persistence 
-Launch volumes as encrypted volumes
-You can create point-in-time snapshots of EBS volumes, which are persisted
to Amazon S3

Amazon EBS Use Cases
-------------------
-OS: Use for boot/root volume
-Databases: Sclaes with your performance 
-Enterprise applications: Provides reliable block storage to run 
mission critical applications
-Business continuity: Minimize data loss and recovery time by regularly
backing up using EBS snapshots
-Applications: Install and presist any application 

EBS Scope
---------
-Amazon EBS volumes are in single availability zones

Difference 
----------
Storage layer persistency


AWS Shared responsibility model
------------------------------
-Customers are responsible for security IN the cloud
-AWS is responsible for the security OF the cloud 


SSL Endpoints
-------------
-SSL enpoints : Secure transmission to establish secure communication
sessions (HTTPS)
-Security groups: Instance firewalls
-PVC: Network control use public and private NAT, VPN support in your private
cloud

AWS Multi-tier Security groups
------------------------------
-Web tier
-Application tier
-Database tier

AWS Indentity and access management
-----------------------------------
-IAM users and their access 

AWS IAM authentication
----------------------
-Access key and secret key
-Access to a particular service

AWS IAM user management groups
------------------------------
-User
-Dev ops group
-Tester

AWS IAM authorization
---------------------
-IAM Policies are JSON documents to describe permision 

AWS cloudTrail
--------------
-Records AWS API calls for accounts
-Delivers log files with information
