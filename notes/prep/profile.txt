1) Elevator pitch
-----------------
I am an experienced Big data enginner primarily focused on data ingestion using distributed systems
in the Hadoop ecosystem. In my position working at Data Reply as a Big data engineer, I worked on
the implementation of data ingestion from RDBMS, Batch processes and queries into messaging sytems.
The implementation personally falls into monitoring and testing data using scripts, development 
of spark consumers to clean, test and peform aggregations using scala and python scripts.
And extensive use of kafka for the development of pipelines, configuring producers from APIs calls,
logs from systems and data migration from RDBMS systems.

One project that I was heavily involved in was for a company providing information solutions, they
primarily analysed systems for performance and quality of data. Having multiple systems, they wanted 
a centralized location for all of their data. Using batch requests to get the data into kafka, I took
part in creating scripts to test how the data would be best ingested into a topic, cleaning the data 
by following specifications using spark and involvement in testing the pipeline.


-Most of the data was logs from events, user data and information about specifications
-The organization typically indentified critical systems and their processes that are most critical 
 and implement changes

-I took part in many other projects, but not a deeply. Most of my tasks were involved in the development
 of scripts to check for reliability in the pipelines, heavily involving testing of separate components 
 using Java, Scala and python. Data profiling to check if there are issues with the source data, 
 identify the structure of the data and report on the quality and if there are any necessary changes.



2) Most recent project 
----------------------
One project that I was heavily involed in was for a company providing IT solutions by analysing systems for
performance and quality of data. The project was to develop a centralized storage of data from all of their
systems. Using a Hadoop cluster as the centralized repository for all the log files of their systems, then
the integration of kafka to retrieve, clean and validate data. I took part in processing of data to Hadoop, 
using Sqoop for traditional RDBMS systems, for unstructured data and data profiling such as log files used
flume with python. Futher in the project, I managed to

Big data engineer responsibilities
----------------------------------
-Designing, creating, testing and maintaining the complete data management & processing systems
-Ensuring architecture meets the business requirements
-Building highly scalable, robust & fault-tolerant systems
-Taking care of the complete ETL process 
-Discover data acquisitions opportunities 
-Find ways & methods to find value out of existing data 
-Improving data quality, reliability & efficiency of the individual components & the complete 
 system
-Creating a complete solution by integrating a variety of programming languages and tools together
-Creating data models to reduce system complexities and hence increase efficiency & reduce cost
-Introduce new data management tools and technologies into the existing system to make it more 
 efficient 

Big data analytics for risk management
--------------------------------------
Organizations need to be able to implement a structured evolutionary so as to accommodate the broad
scope of big data. To achieve this, organizations collect the internal data first so as to gain clear
insights that will benefit them. More important is the integrated process of analysis that a company 
uses, a proper big data analytics system helps ensure that areas of weaknesses or potential risks are 
indentified.

UBO bank from Singapore, uses big data to drive risk management, the big data risk management system 
enables the bank to reduce the calculation time of the value at risk.

Big data analytics as a driver of innovation and product development
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Help companies innovate and redevelop their products. Big data has become an avenue for creating 
additional revenue streams through enabling innovations and product improvement. Start by correcting as 
much data as would be technically possible before designing new product lines and re-designing the
existing product.
To improve the quality and streamline your manufactoring performance you need to collect huge data, 
tracking their products, competitors and customer feedback.
Once data is availed, an analysis is then conducted to ensure logical reasoning is applied before an
action plan is devised. Luckily, product manufactorers of every size have a unique advantage when it 
comes to gathering and harnessing big data.              

Focusing on big data analytics, amazon whole foods is able to understand how customers buy groceries and
how suppliers interact with the grocer. This data gives insights whenever there is need to implement 
further changes.

*This issue also happends in reverse, if your analysts find that they need the data differently structured, you'll
 have to remake the format from that direction.
*Even if you set up these scripts beautifully, they will experience small failures from time to time. You'll need 
 a way to be alerted to problems, a way to locate and repair them quickly, and a means of recovering or reprocessing 
 any data lost in the shuffle.
