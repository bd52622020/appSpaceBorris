				Resilient Distributed Dataset

RDD: imutable data structures 
DataFrame: abstraction of an RDD, tabular data structure
DataSets: extension of a dataFrame, type safe---code in Java or Scala
Query optimizer/ Catalyst optimizer: Spark software

* Schema-less distributed collection of immutable JVM objects
* A backbone of Apache Spark
* Datasets are split into chunks and distributed to executor nodes

1) Creating RDDs
	- Paralize collection: list of values, tuples
	- Read file
