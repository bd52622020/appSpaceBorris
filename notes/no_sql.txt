                            No-SQL Databases

There are four types of No-SQL databases:
-Document store
-Graph base
-Key value store
-Column 

HBase and Cassandra are the best examples of column store types
---------------------------------------------------------------
HBase should be used when the big data application has 
-A variable schema
-Data is stored in the form of collections
-If the application demands key based access to data while retrieving

ACID Theorem
------------
Atomicity: Ability of the database to guarantee that all of the tasks of a transaction are 
performed or none of them are.

Consistency: Database remains in a consistent state before the start and after the transaction
is over.

Isolation: Requirement of other operations cannot access or see the data in an intermediate 
state during a transaction.

Durability: Guarantee that once the user has been notified of success, the transaction will
persist, and not be undone.


CAP Theorem
-----------
Consistency: every read would get the most recent write available in table.

Availability: If node failed then it should always execute the queries.

Partition tolerance: Even if connections between nodes are down, others should be kept in place.
