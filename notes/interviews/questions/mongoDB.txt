What is MongoDB
---------------
Distributed NoSQL database, document oriented and fexibility by storing data in a JSON like structure
with fields changing over time. As a distributed system, its highly available, can scale horizontally
and the document model maps to the objects in your application code.

How is data stored in MongoDB
-----------------------------
MongoDB stored data in collections, documents and fields. Compared to traditional RDBMS systems, 
Collections can be seen as tables, documents as rows and fields as columns.

Document management 
-------------------
Normalization: Storing data into multiple collections with references between them, data is defined
once, making writing easy. Reading can be slower due to the need to receive data from multiple 
collections, you have to perform multiple queries.

Denormalization: Storing muiltiple data embedded in a single document. Better performance on reads
but slower on writes and it will take up more space.

1:N Relationships
-----------------
Embedding an array of documents into the parent table is not always the best solution, knowing when
to normalize and denormalize is very important. 
  
  -One to few: Embed the array in the parent document 
  -One to many: Consider two collections, every part will have a reference that will be present in
  the parent document

Smart indexing 
--------------
For good performance, the implementation of a smart indexing system will streamline your write and 
read operations. The indexing advantages and limitations for MongoDB is very important, a limit of 
32MB in holding memory for a sort operation.
