1)What is Hive
--------------
Apache hive is a warehouse software for ETL purposes and managing large distributed data sets, Hive
was built on top of HDFS but can also use other storage systems such as HBase. Hive enables SQL
developers to use a similar language called HiveQL to perform queries and Hive then translates the
queries into map/reduce jobs.

Hive abstracts the complexity of Hadoop by providing an interface where users can submit SQL queries,
allowing schema flexibility with evolution and tables can be partitioned and bucketed. There are
JDBC/ODBC drivers available to access Hive, the drivers use Thrift to communicate with the drivers.

2)Metastore
-----------
The Hive metastore enables you to apply a table structure to the data, with the Hive table you can
define the columns, rows and data types. All the information about the Hive tables is stored in the
metastore and becomes part of the Hive architecture. Other applications such as Spark can then access
the data in the metastore.

3)Use cases
-----------
Hive is integrated with Hadoop, intended for long sequential scans, queries in Hive have a very high
latency. Hive is less appropriate for applications that need very fast response times, Hive is read
based thus un-fit for transaction processing. Hive is suited for data warehousing tasks such as ETL,
reporting and data analysis including SQL like access. Ad-hoc queries at run time for creating
reports

4)Hive architecture
-------------------
Metastore: A relational database storing the metadata of hive tables, partitions and databases

Driver: Connect with the client

Compiler:

Optimizer:

Executor:

5)Types of tables in Hive
-------------------------
There are two types of tables, managed and external tables. In managed tables both the data and a
schema is under control of hive, but in external tables only the schema is under control of Hive.

6)What is custom serde
----------------------
Depending on the data, the user can use inbuilt SerDe but if it does not satisfy the format of the
data, users can write their own java code to satisfy their data format requirements. A SerDe allows
Hive to read in data from a table and write it back out to HDFS in any custom format. E.g. Avro,
ORC, RegExm Thrift, Parquet and CSV.

7)Hive run modes
----------------
Local mode, Distributed mode and Pseudodistributed mode.

8)What is a Hive variable
-------------------------
Created in the Hive environment, can be referenced by Hive scripts. It is used to pass some values
to the hive queries when the query starts executing.
