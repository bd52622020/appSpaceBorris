                         Introduction

Aim: This is indended to be a practical and useful guide to machine learning
     and it's application to real-world prolbems. Essential principles for
     understanding and effective application of machine learning.


1: Linear algebra for machine learning 

   intro: Exploration of algorithms
        - K-Nearest neighbors algorithm, basis of a technique for simulating 
          observations within a data set 

   * Most algorithms are extremely flexible, these algorithms are not applied
     to data, they are applied to vector spaces.
   
   * The model was able to be applied to the data, because the data set was
     given an abstract representation as a vector space.
   
   * The limit of applying a machine learning aproach, is the ability to 
     represent  the data within an appropriate vector space.

   * Some data sets, require extremely high-dimensional spaces to provide 
     adequate representation. Requiring a great deal of creativity, 
     understanding the concept of a vectors space:
        - Dimensionality of a vector space
        - How vectors can have the same algebraic form as other objects
        - How a vector space is an "appropriate" representation of the data
        
   Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces, linear transformations between
   vector spaces, and the representation and properties of spaces and 
   transformations. Providing the theoratical basis for giving the necessary
   abstract representations of data.
