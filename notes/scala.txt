					Scala

* Integrates features of functional and object-oriented languages
-Syntactic flexibility
-For comprehension
-Unified type system: Everything is an inherited object of Any:
-Uses singleton instead of static
 



OOP
-Every values is an object
-Types and behavior of objects are described by classes and traits
-Class abstractions are extended by subclassing
