			Elevator pitch


Introduction:

My name is Boris, I have studient architecture from Newcastle University,
where I learned a creative approach towards solving problems. I began my 
technology carrer as an RPA developer, automating data pipelines such as
data tranfer from a database in excel to a CRM system using a secured
genereted password. Culminating in getting my advanced certificate in UiPath.

My experience as a developer improved by learning the .NET framework, 
I took part in developing the back-end application of a website by using 
ADO.net, allowing data access from a SQL database to the application.

I have developed a test driven development when writing code, focusing on
the reliability and quality of code. As a developer I have learned to 
write code using the SOLID principles to achieve low coupling and high cohesion.


As a big data engineer, I value a reliable infrastructure meaning data is 
checked, validated and stored correctly.  


why are you a good fit for the role?

* Architecture taught me to look at systems, as a cluster of layers, each for a
different purpose but all of them working together as a whole. 

* Architecture taught me to make the best use of resources weather 
that is the sun, CPU memory, efficient code, worker nodes.
