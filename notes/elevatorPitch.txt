1)Tell me about yourself
------------------------
My name is Boris, I have studient architecture from Newcastle University,
where I learned a creative approach towards solving problems. I began my
technology carrer as an RPA developer, automating data pipelines such as
data tranfer from a database in excel to a CRM system using a secured
genereted password. Culminating in getting my advanced certificate in UiPath.

My experience as a developer improved by learning the .NET framework,
I took part in developing the back-end application of a website by using
ADO.net, allowing data access from a SQL database to the application.

I have developed a test driven development when writing code, focusing on
the reliability and quality of code. As a developer I have learned to
write code using the SOLID principles to achieve low coupling and high cohesion.

be their opinion about you?. What will they say that you need to work on?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Their opinion of me would be that he was always on time and completed  
his job to the best of his abilities. They will say that he needs to
improve his ability to stand his ground when exchanging ideas.


6)Did you ever have a conflict with your current/previous boss or professor?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, It might be conflict but I look at it more like a misanderstanding,
During a project, the manager of our team, had set the task of creating a
basic pipeline connecting an SQL database to our backend project. I raised 
a concern based on how long it would take, we discused the project in more
detail and came to the conclusion that it will be better to reduce the 
detail required.

My friends will most likely mention my playful nature, I have a relaxed 
personality and enjoy socialising. My co-workers will probably mention
that I remain clam under pressure and like to help people when they 
dont understand something. 


8)What did you do in the last year to improve your knowledge?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Last year I began to improve my knowledge by solving coding puzzles in 
code warriors, in order to solve ecah puzzle I had to get detailed 
information about a specific topic and build my code to pass all the 
test cases in order to receive the credit. I have gained a deeper
insight into how to write efficient code. 


9)Explain the difference between group and team?
------------------------------------------------
In my opinion, I see group as something where each member has something
in common with each other, in the other hand I see team as a group of
people who work together to achieve a particular goal.


10)What is your ideal company or workplace?
-------------------------------------------
I believe what makes a company great, is their ability to communicate 
effectively in all sectors from the company. A place where people can 
rely on eachother to complete their task and follow a particular goal.


11)Have you ever had to provide negative feedback? what was your approach?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, the approach that I have taken is to first tell the person all the work 
that he has done well, ask if there is something going on that has affected 
his work, tell the person what the issue is and a path that he can take to 
improve things.


12)What is the most difficult thing that you've ever accomplished?
------------------------------------------------------------------
The most difficult thing that I have ever done was to build good habits,
it was easy to just sit in my computer and just watch tv or play games.
I struggled to use my time efficiently, I decided to dedicate 
five minutes to improve something until It became easy to create good 
habits.

 
13)What is the difference between hard work and smart work?
-----------------------------------------------------------
In my opinion, hard work most often happens when we are not able to
find good ways to get the job done due to lack of knowledge,
resources, creativity or willingness. Smart work in the other
hand is to understand what you need to do and
find the best approach to get the job done with the resources
that you have.  


14)How do you feel about working weekends and night shifts?
-----------------------------------------------------------
In my opinion, the nature of projects have some degre of uncertainty that can
be very hard to control, in those cases there might be the need to work 
overtime when there are critical issues that need to be fixed and dealt with
and in those situation I would understand why and would try my best to get
the job done.


15)Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
----------------------------------------
I am an abitious person, I believe that if you are not learning something new 
you are forgeting something that you knew. Having said that I do realize that 
you cant always control where you might end up but I do see myself as someone
who has great experince, has the ability to make great descicions and someone
who can lead people.  


16)Give an example of a time you had to respond to an unhappy manager
---------------------------------------------------------------------


17)How quickly do you adapt to new technology?
----------------------------------------------
I have learned a wide range of technologies such as RPA, software development 
and Big data analytics. I believe that having a record of learning new things
shows that I have the capability to learn and master new technologies and that 
many of the things that I have learned can be applicable to learning something 
new. 


18)On a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate yourself as a leader and why?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would rate myself an 8 as a leader, there are two aspects for my score, 
one is because I believe in giving and receiving feedback so that everybody 
in the team can learn and grow. The other aspect is the ability to understand
people. A good example took place during a team project, we had the task to
create a mock up website to explore how to efficiently connect to a database.
Understanding the people in my group and their strengths, I suggested that 
we should delegate work depending on what they are confortable with. As a 
result we got work done alot more efficiently and we all enjoyed working 
together. 


19)What are your future goals?
My future goals are to learn as much as I can, that involves learning new software,
taking new hobbies and meeting new people. I want to be able to have the experience
needed to be able to lead people, to help them as some people have helped me in
my carrer and studies.


20)What are you passionate about?
I am passionate about learning, its not just confined to learning new softwares but
to be able to take new exiting hobbies, to explore things that I havent tried 
before, to talk to interesting people and listening to their opinions. I am currently
designing my own notebook, I was not able to find one that fullfilled my needs so 
I began to work on my own notebook.


21)What are you most proud of?
I am most proud of finishing university, during my second year of university studying
architecture, I began to enjoy architecture less but I decided to finish what I 
started and graduate. After I realised that being a proffesional is most often doing
things that have to be done regardless of the circumstances.


22)How do you respond to change?
Depending on the situation, I would first investigate if there are any new conflicts
due to the change, if there are conflicts then meassure how important and urgent 
they are. I would then use this hierarchy to first deal with the most importnat and
work my way down until there are no more conflicts to resolve.

-------------------------------
Depending on the situation, if a project is very demanding then I will
mirror what the project demands of me and my team to get the job done.

and how to find what you need.

------------------------------------------------
I would describe my time management skills to be prudent, I personally think that

circumstances that could delay what you have planned.

work with friendtly people, everybody in the team can learn and grow much more.


28)What was a tough decision you had to make at the work place?
---------------------------------------------------------------
During the end of a project, having performed well in the area of RPA. 
I was presented with the opportunity to work and learn the .NET framework, a much 
more indeph task. I decided to jump on board, my lack of experience made it hard to
keep up but with time I managed to learn and get hands on experience building 
projects and learned a whole new set of skills.   


29)If you won the lottery, would you still work?
------------------------------------------------
I would still work, because it is not just about earning money for a living. But it
is also about learning, growing as a person, making meaningfull connections with 
people and contributing back to the community and have enough experience to one day
be able to teach and lead people.


30)How do you work under pressure?
----------------------------------

hierarchical list with the most important at the top and focus on completing one task
at a time until the task is completed.
