In order to flatten a JSON completely we don't have any predefined function in Spark.
We will write a function that will accept DataFrame. For each field in the DataFrame
we will get the DataType
  -If the field is of ArrayType we will create new column with exploding the ArrayColumn
  using Spark explode_outer function.
  -If the field is of StructType we will create new column with parentfield_childfield 
  for each field in the StructType field.

This is a recursive function, once the function doesn't find any ArrayType or StructType.
It will return the flattened DataFrame. Otherwise, it will iterate through the schema to
completely flatten out the JSON.
