Serverless or FaaS Differ from PaaS
-----------------------------------
Serverless architecture

PaaS: Platform as a service
-Offers many of the same benefits as serverless. They do eliminate the need for management
of server hardware and software.
-Primary difference is in the way you compose and deploy your application, and therefore 
the scalability of your application.
-Deployed as a single unit and is developed in the traditional way using some kind of web 
framework like ASP.NET 
FaaS: Function as a service  
-Compose your application into individual, autonomous functions
-Each function is hosted by the FaaS provider
-Can be scaled automatically as function call frequency increases of decreases
-Cost effective way of paying for compute serources 
-Only pay for the times that your functions get called, rathen than paying to have your 
application on and waiting for requests on so many different instances.
