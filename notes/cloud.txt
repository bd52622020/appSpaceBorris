				Cloud

Why cloud?
Moving away from dedicated servers, single point of failure and expertise needed 
to maintain servers.

What is cloud?
Outsource the need of storage, processing, services and infrastructure.

*The cloud is the internet
*The cloud is a utility
*Services are provided on a pay-as-you-go basis

Current state of cloud computing:
-Cloud computing services is becoming the biggest revenue
generator for leading software companies.

Public cloud:
-Service provider makes resources, such as applications and storage,
available to the general public over the internet.


Private cloud:
-Through a proprietary architecture
-Single organization
-Best for businesses with dynamic or unpredictable computing
needs that require direct control over their system.


Hybrid cloud:
-Mix of on-premises, private cloud and third-party
-Allowing workloads to move between private and public
clouds as computing needs and costs change, flexibility.


Top growing cloud servies:
-Serverless architecture
-Container-as-a-service

-DBaas NoSQL
-DRaaS


Abstraction & Virtualization
----------------------------

Virtualization: On a data center, depending on the customer, there exists 
containers which can be provisioned to customer.

*Removing the process of relying on a piece of software

Abstraction: Universal access, details are abstracted. The services will be
provisioned the same way.  

Service Models:
-Infrastructure as a service(IaaS): Provide virtual machines, storage
-Platform as a service(PaaS)
-Software as a service(SaaS)

Benefits:
-On-demand self service
-Broad network access
-Resource pooling
-Rapid elasticity
-Measured service
