Introduction

-Good morning
-My name is...evelator pitch

Overview
--------
-Proposal: The financial market is the backbone of the economy, millions of transactions occurring
 everyday. My proposal attempts to use real time financial market data to retrieve stock market 
 data. The aim of my project is to store FOREX trading records of a particular currency and store
 it for further analytical purposes and take advantage of the real time capabilities of kafka to 
 potentially trigger scripts when a certain value is reached.

-Overview of my project: As the source of my project, I will be using the TwelveData API to obtain
 FOREX stock data, the API call will then return metadata and time series information in a json 
 format. Data will come as a batch request with a frequency of 1 min 

-Kafka: For its distributed, resilient and fault tolerant architecture. The ability to gather data 
 parallely using multiple currencies.
  -Create a new topic for each currency, e.g. EUR/USD or EUR/GBP

-Spark: For the processing stage of my pipeline, for its high speed data analysis by taking advantage
 of in-memory computation and the ability to perform aggregate functions

-HBase: To store time series data with the ability to scale horizontally if more storage is needed,
 Efficient scans when querying data points and high write throughput, due to its column oriented
 architecture, it becomes more effcient to get a particlar column such as 'high' or 'low' of the data
