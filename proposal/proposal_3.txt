				Financial market Proposal 

case:

The financial market is the backbone of the economy, millions of transactions 
occuring everyday. My proposal attempts to use a real time financial market 
data API to retrieve stock market data. The aim of my project is then to use
the FOREX trading records of a particular currency and find patterns in a 
given timeframe.


Source:

The Twelve-data API is to be used to obtain financial market data of Forex
stocks. The API call will return meta and time series information in a CSV
format.
The data will come as a batch request with a frequency of 1min.

-Meta object consists of general information about requested currency pair
-Time series contains as array of objects: Datatime, Open, High, Low, Close
